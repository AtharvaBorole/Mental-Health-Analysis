The tech industry is known for its demanding work culture, long hours, and high-stress environments, all of which can significantly impact mental health. Despite increasing awareness, stigma around mental health issues persists, preventing many professionals from seeking the help they need. This project analyzes real-world survey data to identify key trends, challenges, and workplace factors that influence mental health in the tech industry. By leveraging data analytics, we explore how company policies, workplace support, and demographic factors contribute to employees' mental well-being.

Organizations with strong mental health policies and open discussions report higher levels of employee well-being and treatment-seeking behavior.
Gender, region, and company size influence mental health awareness and the availability of support systems.
There is a noticeable gap in access to mental health resources, with smaller companies often lacking formal support programs.
Technologies Used
Python: Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
